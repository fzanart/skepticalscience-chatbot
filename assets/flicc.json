        "definition": "Carefully selecting data that appear to confirm one position while ignoring other data that contradicts that position.",
        "example": "Global warming stopped in 1998.;OR We know for sure that the winter of 2014 was one of the coldest in US history, which suggests that global warming is not happening."

    "Conspiracy Theory": {
        "definition": "Proposing that a secret plan exists to implement a nefarious scheme such as hiding a truth.",

        "definition": "Presenting an unqualified person or institution as a source of credible information.",
        "example": "A retired physicist argues against the climate consensus, claiming the current weather change is just a natural occurrence.;OR Nobel Prize winning scientists have publicly expressed their skepticism about climate change."

    "False Choice": {
        "definition": "Presenting two options as the only possibilities, when other possibilities exist.",

        "definition": "Demanding unrealistic standards of certainty before acting on the science.",

        "definition": "Misrepresenting a situation or an opponent's position in such a way as to distort understanding.",
