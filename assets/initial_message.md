Welcome!  

The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating based on food choices in countries that border the Mediterranean Sea (in particular: Greece, Spain, and Southern Italy). 
This includes eating lots of fresh vegetables, fish, and olive oil, and not much red meat or processed foods. 
Part of the Mediterranean diet is also about lifestyle: sharing meals with other people, eating slowly, and exercising regularly. 
Studies have found that this way of eating is associated with lower risk of poor health outcomes and is especially protective against cardiovascular disease.
