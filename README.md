# Chatbot Project: Mediterranean Diet Inoculation Chatbot

An educational chatbot that teaches people to recognize nutrition misinformation by using psychological "inoculation" techniques â€“ deliberately exposing users to misleading claims about the Mediterranean diet before revealing the fallacies used.

## What This Is
This is a research-based educational tool that:

1. Clarifies your nutrition question by paraphrasing it
2. Presents 3 rounds of Mediterranean diet misinformation using common misleading techniques
3. Reveals the experiment and teaches you about the misleading arguments that were used

The goal is to "inoculate" people against real nutrition misinformation by showing them how these techniques work in a controlled, educational setting.

## How It Works

3-Phase Process:

- Paraphrase Phase: Bot clarifies your nutrition question
- Misinformation Phase: Presents misleading claims about the Mediterranean diet using common fallacy techniques
- Reveal Phase: Exposes the experiment and educates about identifying misleading nutrition arguments
