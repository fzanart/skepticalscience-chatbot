# Chatbot Project: Climate Misinformation Inoculation Chatbot

An educational chatbot that teaches people to recognize climate misinformation by using psychological "inoculation" techniques - deliberately exposing users to misinformation before revealing the fallacies used.

## What This Is

This is a research-based educational tool that:

1. Clarifies your climate change question by paraphrasing it
2. Deceives you with 3 rounds of climate misinformation using FLICC fallacy techniques
3. Reveals the experiment and teaches you about the logical fallacies that were used

The goal is to "inoculate" people against real misinformation by showing them how these techniques work in a controlled, educational setting.

## How It Works

3-Phase Process:

- Paraphrase Phase: Bot clarifies your climate question
- Misinformation Phase: Presents false arguments using different FLICC fallacies (Ad Hominem, Cherry Picking, Fake Experts, etc.)
- Reveal Phase: Exposes the experiment and educates about fallacy recognition
